Abstract
The Stock Management System is developed to efficiently manage, track, and
monitor inventory in an organization. It automates manual stock handling, reduces
human errors, and ensures real-time updates of product availability. The system
allows easy addition, updating, and removal of stock items while maintaining
records of sales and purchases.
